# Omarchy Scripts

**A community-driven repository for Omarchy scripts to simplify your workflow.**  

Right now, this repo includes:  
- **Shell Switcher Script** – Quickly switch between different shells.  
- **Theme Installer Script** – Automatically fetch and install themes from the [awesome-omarchy](https://github.com/aorumbayev/awesome-omarchy) page.  

> **Contributions are welcome! If you have a useful script idea that Omarchy doesn’t have yet and others could benefit from, feel free to open a PR.**
